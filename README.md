# Maigunmod
Mod that adds some obscure and familiar firearms to your Cataclysm.
Also includes several locations found in cities or towns where one can find these firearms.
Currently in-progress, will have a functioning release once a suitable amount of content is made.




Do keep in mind of accidental overlaps when used with other firearm mods.
